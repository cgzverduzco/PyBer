 ##  Summary business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Carry out marketing campaigns to generate greater demands.

    The averanges about rides count by city are:

        - Urban: 24
        - Suburban : 17
        - Rural : 6

    ### Summary rides count by city

    The ratios about rides vs drivers are: 

    - Urban: 0.67
    - Suburban : 1.2
    - Rural : 1.6 

    It's possible that the urban drivers didn't have a trip in the period from January to May. This behavior is almost equal in suburban and rural cities, with different ratios.

    It is essential to **carry out marketing campaigns to generate greater demands** for change, the ratio of trips vs. drivers, and generate a greater profit from drivers.

2. Human resources management with projection in future demand

    In urban cities, demand exceeds supply, this makes fare travel cheaper. The opposite happened in rural cities. It's recommendable to have the correct number of drivers per city.

    Managing human resources must meet the system's strategic needs. A future demand projection must be carried out to calculate the correct number of drivers.

3. Create universal KPI to measure 

    The nature of each type of city creates micro markets. For urban cities, the movement is greater than that of a rural-type city. It is necessary to create KPI that apply to all types of cities, it could be travel vs. population.
